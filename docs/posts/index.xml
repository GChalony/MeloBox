      <description>The MelodyBox is meant to give a physical existence to music, as used to exist with vinyls and CDs. The idea is simply to use a small NFC tag which will identify the music that should be played, and to have some kind of reader to read this ID and play the corresponding music.
What is convenient about this is that the NFC tag can be embeded in almost any kind of object, as long as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t intefere with the radiowaves used to read it.</description>
