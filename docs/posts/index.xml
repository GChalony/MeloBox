      <description>The MelodyBox is meant to give a physical support to music, as used to exist with vinyls and CDs. This requires two things :
 a physical object that can identifying music a reader which can read the music to play from the object and play it  The object is an NFC tag, and the reader is an NFC reader coupled with a rasperryPi.
What is convenient about this is that the NFC tag can be embeded in almost any kind of object, as long as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t intefere with the radiowaves used to read it.</description>
